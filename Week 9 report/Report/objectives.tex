The aim of this project is to implement high performance, scalable library for computing abstract argumentation semantics (complete, preffered, stable, grounded, semi-stable and stage semantics) for given argumentation framework. Furthermore, it should have the ability to compute if the given argument from the given argumentation framework is credulously or skeptically inferred for given semantics.
This project can be divided into four separate stages: research, design, development and evaluation. Although the stages proposed can be performed in the sequence, work on this project will be performed in the iterative way. In the work plan for the project, 3 iterations of desing, development and testing have been identified. Additionally, further research might be required in the later stages. Each stage of the project have overall goals that will neeed to be achieved. 

Research and review stage is the vital part of the project. This will allow to build a better understanding of the problem domain and investigate existing solutions. Following goals can be identified for this stage:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{Research concept of argumentation framework and abstract argumentation semantics}
	\item{Research and review existing algorithms for solving the problem}
	\item{Review solvers submitted to ICCMA 2017}
	\item{Perform technology review}
\end{enumerate}

Once enough research will be performed, the project can proceed to next stages. The knowledge gathered will be used to define the requirements and propose appropriate solution. The design, development and testing stages will be performed in an iterative way. Goals for those stages include:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{Perform Requirements Analysis}
	\item{Define Test Plan}
	\item{Based on the requirements analysis design appropriate solution} 
	\item{Implement the proposed solution}
	\item{Test the solution to verify implemented requirements}
	\item{Perform benchmark testing to evaluate the performance and correctness of the solution}
\end{enumerate}
As mentioned above, 3 iterations of those stages have been initially scheduled. Additionaly, during any of those stages further research might be required.

The outcome of the project will be the developed library for computing abstract argumentation framework. Furthermore, depending on the evaluation process, the library will be used to develop a solver for abstract argumentation framework to be submitted to International Competition on Computational Models of Argumentation \cite{ICCMA}. Hence there are number of requirements that will have to be included in the implementation.
