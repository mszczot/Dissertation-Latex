The overall schedule for the project can be seen in appendix \ref{appendix:projectSchedule}. At the beginning of the project the majority of the work will be based on research and planning of the project. This will allow to build the knowledge neccessary for advancing the project to achieve its goal. During the later stages of the project three iterations of design, development and testing processes have been scheduled. Initially one week is allocated to design and testing stages and two weeks for development. Furthermore, during the weekly meetings with project supervisor, Simon Wells, a set of tasks is created to be achieved for the following weeks. Notes from the meetings can be seen in appendix \ref{appendix:diaries}. During the meetings the progress of the project is reviewed and a set of goals is set to be accomplished for the following meeting.
