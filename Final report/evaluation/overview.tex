\subsection{Overview}
In this section ALIAS solver will be evaluated in terms of functional and non-functional requirements discussed in section 4.2. Each implemented approach will be reviewed in terms of performance. Furthermore, ALIAS will be compared to other solvers in relation to its performance and scalability. Finally, the ease of use will be evaluated.

Another evaluation will be performed on ALIAS web interface. This extension will be evaluated in terms of functionality and usability.
