\subsection{Web User Interface Evaluation}
Web User Interface has been introduced as an extension of ALIAS application in order to maximize the usability and easy of use. Testing of the Web Interface consist of executing previously prepared test cases for all critical and high priority functionalities. As could be seen in section \ref{section:testCases}, all test cases passed.

\subsubsection{Functionality Evalution}
Majority of the functionality of ALIAS Web User Interface comes from the solver itself. The Web UI makes calls to ALIAS through exposed API to manipulate argumentation frameworks. Based on the requirements analysis, user can create new or load existing argumentation framework (this is limited only to trivial graph formats), add arguments and attacks and request all possible complete, stable or preferred extensions to be completed. 

Additional tasks per extension have not been exposed in Web Interface during this project. Although those functionalities could have been useful, especially to determine if given argument is credulously or skeptically accepted in given argumentation framework, they have been categorized low priority items. They will be included in the future work.

ALIAS Web UI gives user the ability to easily visualize the argumentation framework by using cytoscape.js framework. Displaying the
