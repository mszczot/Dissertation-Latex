\subsection{Conclusion}
To summarize the evaluation, ALIAS provides a lot of functionalities identified during the requirement analysis. Not only all critical items have been successfully delivered during the project, but the solution has been extended to accommodate less important functionalities. 

In terms of performance and scalability, ALIAS is still in the early stages of development. Implemented SAT based approach gives a lot of opportunities to improve the solution to match existing solvers.

Finally, ALIAS Web User Interface is a good extension of the application. It allows user to use ALIAS through web interface and easily visualize argumentation frameworks.
