\subsection{Web User Interface}

\subsubsection{Usability}
In terms of usability, ALIAS Web Interface can be extended to bind mouse events on the argumentation framework graph and bind them to certain functionalities of ALIAS. For example, double tap on the white space of the page could add a new argument, while clicking and holding mouse button on argument could start drawing attack. 

Changing the interface to a standard editor interface would also help user to learn it faster and be able to perform the operations with ease. Introducing toolbar with standard icons, for example similar to Gliffy interface shown in figure \ref{fig:toolbarExample}, could further enhance the usability.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{toolbar_example}
	\caption{Gliffy toolbar}
	\label{fig:toolbarExample}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Functionality}
Further expansion could be made to allow user to view properties of each node and edge in the side panel. This would give an insight of elements of displayed argumentation framework.
