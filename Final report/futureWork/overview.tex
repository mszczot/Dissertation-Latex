\subsection{Overview}

Although this project was successful in terms of providing an easy to setup and use argumentation framework semantics solver, a lot of work have been left for the future. Current implementation allow ALIAS to only solve Complete, Preferred and Stable extensions. Hence, there is the opportunity to expand the system to be able to compute Semi-Stable, Ideal, Grounded and Stage semantics as well.
