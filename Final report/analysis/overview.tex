\section{Overview}
In this section, solvers for computing abstract argumentation semantics will be reviewed in terms of performance and scalability. The availability of few solvers and ease of setup will also be reviewed. Finally, available graphical user interface will be tested and analysed in terms of usability and correctness. The analysis will be mostly performed on the solvers submitted to ICCMA 2017 competition.
