\subsection{Evaluation}
Although there are number of good performing solvers able to work on massive argumentation framework, those applications are usually difficult to setup and start. Solvers submitted to ICCMA competitions have uniform user interface having the same options and parameters. This aids the usability of those solvers as user can move freely between them without many issues.

Research into available technologies indicated that there exists one Graphical User Interface for abstract argumentation semantics - OVA-gen. However, the testing showed that it does not provide correct results for simple argumentation frameworks. Furthermore, the user interface uses old technology and can be difficult to understand.
