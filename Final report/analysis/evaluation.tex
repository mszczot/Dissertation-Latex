\section{Evaluation}
Although there is a number of good performing solvers that are able to work on massive argumentation framework, those applications are usually difficult to set up. Solvers submitted to ICCMA competitions have uniform user interface having the same options and parameters. This aids the usability of those solvers as a user can move freely between them without any issues. However, since those solvers are stand-alone applications, they cannot be used as libraries. Additionally, not all those solvers are available to the public. Although some of them, like Pyglaf or argmat-clpb, are available through GitHub, a lot of those solvers cannot be downloaded at all, like EqArgSolver or goDiamond.


Research into available technologies indicated that there exists one Graphical User Interface for abstract argumentation semantics - OVA-gen. However, the testing showed that it does not provide correct results for simple argumentation frameworks. Furthermore, the user interface uses old technology and can be difficult to understand.
