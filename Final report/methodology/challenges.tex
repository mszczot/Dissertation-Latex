\section{Challenges}
As it is common with most of the projects, this project introduced a number of challenges that would have to be resolved in order to deliver successful solution. One of the most noticeable problem is to find the solution and approach of computing the argumentation framework semantics in a reasonable time. Furthermore, the solution should be able to scale accordingly in order to provide linear computation time on larger argumentation frameworks. As shown by \citet{complexity}, the decision problems for preferred and stable semantics are classified as NP-Complete problems. Furthermore, the remaining semantics can be classified as NP-Complete problems as well.

With number of complexity classes, the NP class stands for nondeterministic polynomial class. Thus, if the problem is classified as the NP-Complete problem, it means that the given solution for the problem can be verified in the polynomial time. However, no efficient way exist to find the solution in the first place \citep{arora2009computational}. This can be observed in the argumentation semantics: verifying given solution, if it is a given extension for example, can be completed in a polynomial time. However, there is no efficient way to compute the semantics in the first place. This most likely will introduce the problems in terms of scalability and performance of ALIAS on larger Argumentation Frameworks.
