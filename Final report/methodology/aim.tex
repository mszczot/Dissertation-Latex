\subsection{Project Aims}
As mentioned previously, the aim of this project is to design scalable python application for computing abstract argumentation semantics that is easily available. Number of solvers already exists that can solve extensions for large argumentation frameworks within reasonable time, however as shown in section \ref{approaches}, they usually require complicated setup and environment. This can prove difficult for anyone without in depth knowledge. Instead, having a library that could be easily imported into a project will allow for easy and fast setup of the environment and allow the user to explore and use argumentation framework extensions out of the box.
