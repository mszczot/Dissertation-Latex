\subsection{Project Aims}
As mentioned previously, the aim of this project is to design scalable, easy to use application for computing abstract argumentation semantics. Number of solvers already exists that can solve extensions for large argumentation frameworks within reasonable time, however as shown in section \ref{section:analysis}, they usually require complicated or are not available for general release. This can prove difficult for anyone without in depth IT knowledge. Instead, having a library that could be easily imported into a project will allow for easy and fast setup of the environment and allow the user to explore and use argumentation framework extensions out of the box.

The project will consist of the main solver that will perform all the required tasks identified during the requirement analysis stage. Furthermore, a web interface will be implemented to help showcase the capabilities of ALIAS, and further improve its usability. Hence, in this section, requirements for both ALIAS and its web interface extension will be discussed.
