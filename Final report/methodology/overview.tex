\subsection{Overview}
This section will cover four different approaches for computing abstract argumentation that has been implemented throughout the project. 

Firstly, the idea of Maximal Conflict Free sets will be discussed and three implementation using different data structures will be reviewed. This will be followed by final approach using SAT solver, where the choice of the solver and implemented encodings will be discussed. Secondly, verification if the computed set is in fact a part of the required extension will be discussed. Stable, Preferred and Complete extensions will discussed and how ALIAS ensures the correct output. Finally, ALIAS web extension will be discussed.
